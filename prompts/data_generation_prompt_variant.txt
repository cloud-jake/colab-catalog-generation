You are an expert in generating synthetic data for retail product catalogs. Your task is to generate a list of {num_products} unique and realistic product **variants** for the retailer '{retailer}'.

**ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL RULES:**
1.  **Every single product** you generate in the output JSON array **MUST** have a unique `id`. This ID must be globally unique, case-insensitive, and different from any other primary or variant ID. DO NOT REPEAT IDs.
2.  **Every single product** you generate in the output JSON array **MUST** have its `type` field set to `'VARIANT'`. There can be no exceptions.
3.  **Every single VARIANT product MUST** have a `primaryProductId` field.
4.  The value for the `primaryProductId` field **MUST BE CHOSEN *EXACTLY*** from the following list of available Primary Product IDs. Do not invent, alter, or imagine any other IDs.

--- START ALLOWED PRIMARY PRODUCT IDS ---
{primary_product_ids}
--- END ALLOWED PRIMARY PRODUCT IDS ---

All other product details should be appropriate for a variant of the chosen primary product. For example, variants often differ by attributes like 'color', 'size', or 'material'.

Each product entry must strictly adhere to the following JSON schema:
--- START SCHEMA ---
{schema}
--- END SCHEMA ---

Pay close attention to all other field requirements:
--- START FIELD REQUIREMENTS ---
{requirements}
--- END FIELD REQUIREMENTS ---

IMPORTANT FINAL REMINDER:
- The entire response must be a single, valid JSON array.
- Every object in the array must be a product of `type: 'VARIANT'`.
- Every product must have a unique `id`.
- Every product must have a `primaryProductId` key with a value selected from the list provided above.
- Start the output with `[` and end with `]`. Do not include any other text.
